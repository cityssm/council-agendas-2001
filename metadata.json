Marie resolves that we support the goal of enacting new legislation and regulations with the aim of achieving the full and equal participation of persons with disabilities in all aspects of Ontario life by creating a barrier free society through the removal of all existing barriers and the prevention of new ones;  We will call on the Ontario Government to enact a strong and effective Ontarians With Disabilities Act in this term, before calling an election.

Jones  Whereas the steel industry is an important and significant part of the economy of North America and typically employs thousands of workers in the many locations in both Canada and the U.S. where steel and steel products are manufactured;  And whereas moreso than ever before, the illegal dumping of cheap foreign steel is causing a serious oversupply and undervaluing of domestic product in an artifically depressed market in North America;  And whereas among the most adversely affected steel companies, Algoma Steel Inc. has announced the need for restructuring its finances, in large part at least due to the negative effects of illegal dumping and low prices for product;  And whereas several Canadian cities including Sault Ste. Marie, rely heavily on the   employment   and   economic   viability   of   the   Canadian   steel   industry   and expects the Federal Government to act quickly and effectively to ensure that there is a level playing field in North American markets and that tariffs are applied where necessary to prevent illegal dumping;  And whereas in the last few weeks all three major Canadian steel producers have asked the senior levels of government to review all current legislation which deals with this recurring problem of dumping of steel with a view to making changes that would allow for an expedient manner of dealing with dumping complaints; 7.   (a)   Now therefore be it resolved that the City of Sault Ste. Marie requests the Federal Government of Canada to immediately undertake a review of the current legislation and process to effectively act on the serious issue of illegal dumping of steel into Canada;  And further be it resolved that this Council expresses its support for all of the efforts that our local Member of Parliament, Carmen Provenzano, regarding this issue, has in the past and will in the future, make on behalf of Algoma Steel Inc., its employees and all of the citizens of Sault Ste.

Marie   and   area   will   benefit   greatly   from   the implementation of this important initiative which will go a long way in promoting interest among doctors and medical students wanting to teach medicine or practice medicine in Northern Ontario;  Now therefore be it resolved that City Council expresses its sincere appreciation to the Premier of Ontario, Mike Harris; the Minister of Health, Tony Clement; and the Minister of Northern Development and Mines, Dan Newman for their support for   this   very   important   initiative   for   all   communities   of   Northern   Ontario.
